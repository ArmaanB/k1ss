ADDING A PAGE
________________________________________________________________________________

Adding a page to the Wiki and integrating it into the home page/listing pages is
rather simple (albeit manual for the time being). This may be automated (to a
realistic extent) over time.

Copy an existing page or start from the @/page-template.txt and begin writing.
When you're ready to submit your page, the following steps must be followed.


Requirements
________________________________________________________________________________

1. Lines must not exceed 80 columns in width. This is a comfortable size for
   reading while not being too narrow for writing. This is a nice sweet spot.

2. Include references where applicable. [0]

3. Pages must be written in English and without error. If this Wiki would like
   to one day be known as a high quality resource, we must write to the best
   of our ability. [1]

4. Do not submit pull requests with spelling mistakes. These will be immediately
   closed. Do spend a minute spell checking your work prior. [2]

5. One space after each sentence.

6. Use only the 128 ASCII characters. [3]


[0] References work like this. Square brackets and a number in two locations.
    The build system will automatically link these together (via an anchor).

[1] Fixes to existing pages and suggestions are welcome. If you see anything
    low-quality, incorrect or in need of fixing, please submit edits.

[2] Exceptions are made for words which only exist in this technological bubble
    of ours. This is common sense.
